-During the summer of 2024, I worked at the Light and Matter Physics Department at Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, India. Here, I worked on trapping  sodium and potassium atoms at ultra-cold temperatures using optical dipole traps.
I also tested lasers through characterization of their physical properties using MATLAB to ensure accurate experimentation. The following is a consolidation of the work I undertook during my internship
